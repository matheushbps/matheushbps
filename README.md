## Hello, I'm Matheus Henrique!

I am a Data Scientist with a strong background in data analysis, predictive modeling, and SQL, currently deepening my expertise with a Master’s in Data Science and Analytics at USP/ESALQ. With over three years of experience at DiDi, the world’s largest mobility services tech company, I developed end-to-end data solutions to support business intelligence, customer experience, and strategic decision-making. Now at Turing, I collaborate with a top FAANG company, specializing in Conversational AI to enhance model efficiency and optimize performance through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).

My work is driven by a passion for extracting actionable insights from data, utilizing Python, SQL, and machine learning techniques to solve complex challenges. Proficient in tools like Power BI and Tableau, I prioritize accessible visual storytelling for data. Additionally, my experience with NLP frameworks like PyTorch and Hugging Face further supports my work in natural language processing applications. Connect with me to explore collaborative opportunities in data science and AI that advance innovative solutions.
