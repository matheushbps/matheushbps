## Hello, I'm Matheus Henrique. I'm graduted in Chemical Engineering at Universidade Federal do Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro (UFTM) and I'm currently doing my MBA at USP/ESALQ in Data Science and Analytics.

### I started working at DiDi Chuxing (a.k.a 99 in Brazil) in 2021, from where I started as FP&A Intern but quickly I became a Data Analyst, position which I worked for my last 3 years.
### I also have a strong background in Data Science, field I started working at the same year of 2021.
### My last position was at Senior Data Analyst, so I can say that today I have a very good technica background as well as a consistent business acumen.

My Main Abilities currently are:

- SQL
- Excel and VBA
- Python and its packages (Pandas, SKlearn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Business Intelligence and its tools (such as Power BI, Tableau)
- Statistics

  I'm currently developing even more my Data Science skills, studying more algorithms, running projects and fine tunning the technical abilities.
